/* scriptc IR — the only interface between frontend and backends.
 *
 * Design rules (see docs/ir.md for node-by-node semantics):
 * - Plain JSON-safe discriminated unions: no classes, no parent pointers,
 *   no cycles. Cross-references are by string id.
 * - Every node carries `loc` (source span) and every expression carries its
 *   computed `type` — backends never re-derive types.
 * - Structured control flow (statement tree), not basic blocks: the only
 * current backend is C and there are no optimization passes yet. When a mid-end
 *   arrives, a structured→CFG lowering pass slots in after validation.
 * - The type union is deliberately written for extension (`dyn` shipped
 *   with JSON, `promise` with async). All switches over IrType/IrExpr/
 *   IrStmt must have exhaustive `never` default arms so adding a member
 *   turns into compile errors, not silent misbehavior.

  // the runtime raises the property-access TypeError those calls really
  // produce (scr_lib.c). It then `return 0`, and with no pending check
  // the 0 was the answer: a deliberate refusal turned into a wrong
  // value. Same target-conditional shape as url.pathToFileURL below.
