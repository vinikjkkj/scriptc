# The synchronous-generator slice: what the first builds measured

Companion to `stackless-sync-generator-slice.md`, which registered the
predictions (section 6) and the correction to them (section 6.1)
**before** any of this ran. This file is the other side of that paper:
what the runs actually said.

A separate file on purpose. Sections 6 and 6.1 record what was believed
beforehand, and editing predictions in place is how a prediction quietly
becomes a description.

## 0. The headline is not the green

Four runs. The one that mattered is the **first**, which was green on nine
arms and measured nothing.

| run | lane | result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | LLVM (unpinned) | 11 of 12 red -- `conversions=0` |
| 2 | C | 10 red -- `conversions=2`, and the als arm exit 99 |
| 3 | C | 7 of 7 files green, `conversions=1` |
| 4 | C | green again, with section 6's last unasserted condition asserted |

## 1. Section 6's predictions, scored

**`EXPECTED_CONVERSIONS = 1`: CONFIRMED on the artefact.** One generator, one
resume function, `0` on every knob-absent build. It took two wrong readings
of the number to get there, and neither was in the emission.

**Section 6's triage for a `0` was wrong.** It said: *look at `stacklessPlan`'s
`syncGenerator` path, not at the lowering.* It was neither. `build()` never
pinned a backend, the CLI default is LLVM, and `index.ts` gates the stackless
lane on `backend === "c"` -- so both lanes compiled through LLVM and the two
builds under comparison were **the same build**. Section 6 did not
consider that the instrument might not be running the lane under test.

**Section 6's triage for a count above `1` was also wrong**, in the same
direction.
It said *I misread what one program emits*; the misreading was in the
counter, which matched the forward declaration as well as the definition:

    static void sc_cr_nums(ScrCoroBase *sc_b);
    static void sc_cr_nums(ScrCoroBase *sc_b) {

`coro-symbol-collect.ts` had already hit this and requires the brace, saying
why in its own comment. The parity guard was written without having read it.

**The generalisation both corrections share:** a reading that goes wrong
about a measurement is more often wrong about the *instrument* than about
the subject, and section 6's triage list pointed at the subject both times.

**Compile errors: predicted, and none appeared.** `tsc` was clean on the
first attempt and every attempt after. The C lane compiled the emitted
generator TU and the new runtime entry points without a diagnostic. The
prediction was reasonable and simply did not happen.

**The poison control: predicted to pass and to be least trustworthy if it
did -- correct, and it stayed untrustworthy longer than section 6
realised.** Section 6 required the conversion count to be non-zero *in the
same run* before the control's green meant anything. Nothing asserted that
until run 4. The control now asserts `conversions = 1` on the poisoned
build itself.

## 2. What the builds found that reading had not

Three defects, none visible without running:

**The instrument measured the wrong lane** (section 1 above). Two independent
instruments said so: the conversion counter, and the poison hook refusing
with *"injected ZERO sites"* because it lives in the C emitter. One fact,
two directions.

**`scr_gen_of_coro` never noted its allocation.** `scr_gen_new` calls
`scr_obj_alloc_note()`; `scr_gen_release` calls `scr_obj_free_note()` for
both backings; the frame lane's constructor called neither. Every converted
generator decremented a counter it had never incremented -- `-1 object(s)`,
a negative count, which is not a shape anyone searches for.

**`scr_gen_coro_alloc` never noted its frame.** Found by the directed audit
section 3 describes. The abandoned-coroutine line could not see a generator
frame at all, so the one lane of three that abandons in silence was also the one
whose comment claimed to be measured.

## 3. The site that inherits nothing

Three omissions at one constructor pair, found one at a time:

| omission | sibling it should have copied | found by |
|---|---|---|
| ALS context never released | `scr_coro_release` | reading, consumer audit |
| object allocation never noted | `scr_gen_new` | the als arm, first real run |
| frame never noted | `scr_coro_alloc` | directed audit after the other two |

Two omissions at one site is not a coincidence; it is a site that inherits
nothing from its siblings because it was written *beside* them rather than
*from* them. The third was found by enumerating every invariant the siblings
maintain and checking them one at a time, instead of waiting for a test to
trip over it. **That enumeration is the cheapest thing in this document and
it found the only defect nobody was looking for.**

## 4. Proof in both directions

Two defects fail in silence -- a stranded ALS context has no stdout, and an
unpromoted `.return` value is a plausible number. For those, *"the arm would
have caught it"* is a claim about an instrument nobody has seen move. So each
was watched failing:

| revert | reverted | restored |
|---|---|---|
| the GENRET promotion | RED | GREEN |
| the ALS release | RED | GREEN |

The ALS red names its own cause: `1 dyn value(s) live at exit`, and the site
table says `1 str` -- the string the arm puts in the context. Detected *and*
attributed.

**The predicted failure MODE was wrong and the arm caught it anyway.** The
GENRET revert was declared as *"no crash, `r.value` is WRONG"*. What happened
was `exit=1`, the unpromoted sentinel reaching the uncaught printer, and the
program dying after the first yield. Right about the colour, wrong about the
mechanism.

## 5. The instrument inside its own subject

Three times in one session, and it is the recurring shape of this front:

- the build cache answered a CLI probe with its own earlier artefact, and
  nearly bought a false conclusion about the knob;
- the conversion counter reported `0` both for *nothing converted* and for
  *there is no C here to read*, and the two are different facts;
- the gate's own provisioning line prints `compiler-dist=ok` for a
  three-day-old `dist`, because it checks presence where freshness is owed.

In each case the instrument's answer was about the instrument. The defence
that worked every time was the same: **make a zero say which zero it is.**

## 6. Still owed, named rather than omitted

- The six-shard merge gate has not run. The rig is ready and refuses on a
  stale `dist` before spending thirty minutes.
- `dist` is stale in every worktree surveyed -- this one by the whole
  generator lowering, `main`'s by the entire stackless front. The CLI
  resolves `dist`; vitest aliases source. Nothing automates the rebuild and
  no check tests its freshness.
- The dist preflight has been shown able to **refuse** (5 of 5 symbols
  absent, with the probe mechanism positive-controlled on a symbol that is
  present). Its green direction is unproven until a rebuild exists to prove
  it against.
- `generator-delegation-divergence.test.ts` is pinned to LLVM and says in
  its own header that it cannot see this lowering and will stay green
  regardless.
