/* The corpus parts go FIRST.
 *
 * vitest's default sequencer orders by the previous run's recorded
 * duration, and falls back to FILE SIZE when it has no record — which is
 * every fresh checkout and every CI job. The corpus entry files under
 * tests/harness/corpus/ are four lines each and carry ~230 corpus programs
 * apiece, so by size they sort dead last: the pool would finish the cheap
 * files and then start its most expensive work with nothing left to
 * overlap it, and the split would buy nothing on exactly the runs that
 * need it most. Hoisting them is a stable partition of whatever order the
 * base sequencer produced, so the rest keeps its (duration-aware) order. */
